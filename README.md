SuperTest, Mocha and Chai are testing tools and assertion libraries for JavaScript that I use to create automated API tests for KasirAja. To get started with testing, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. Open the `Test Case KasirAja Testing` document to view the test cases.
3. Navigate to the `mocha-chai-api-testing` directory.
4. Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies.
5. Run the command `npm run test` to run all tests.
